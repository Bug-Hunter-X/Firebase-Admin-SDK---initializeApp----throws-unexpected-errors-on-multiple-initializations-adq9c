The provided solution offers a more robust approach.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the buggy version: `node admin-init-bug.js`
4. Observe the unexpected error behavior. 
5. Run the solution version: `node admin-init-solution.js`
6. Observe that the solution correctly handles multiple initializations.
